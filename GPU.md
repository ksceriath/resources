GPU , in comparison to CPU, 

- focus on parallelization
	- typical multi-core CPUs can have 16 or something cores, but typical GPU can have thousands of cores
- GPU cores are slower and simpler than CPU
- GPU instruction set is limited


--> GPU cores have independent memory, and communicate with each other by exchanging data via a dedicated bus.
