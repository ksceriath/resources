Elastic Block Storage

![[Excalidraw/EBS]]

A storage service provided by AWS.


Similar to [[EC2]] instances, where instead of Guest VMs we have a EBS service running.

An EBS volume is then mounted as a block device on an EC2 instance.

-> Not meant for sharing : at a time only one EC2 instance can mount a particular EBS 'volume'.
