[ find in multiple paths ]

>> find /path1 /path2 options

[ execute some command on the results ]

>> find /path -name "abc.xyz" -exec mv '{}' /path2 \;
>> find /path -name "abc.xyz" -exec echo '{}' +

{
    -exec   :   specify the command to execute on the found files

    {}    -   gets replaced with the file found
    +       -   all files are placed in one '{}' -- execute just one command
    ;       -   only one file is placed in one '{}' -- execute separate command for each result (need to escape ; )

}

[ multiple searches can be combined using parenthesis ]

>> find /path \( -name "abc*" -o -name "def*" -o -name "ghi*" \) -exec chmod a+x {} +

{
    if options are combined above using parenthesis, then exec operates only on the results of the last option.
}

[ execute with check ]

>> find /path -name "abc.xyz" -ok mv '{}' /path2 \;
{
    -ok     :   like -exec, but prompts for confimation before running the command
}
