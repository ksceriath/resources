#ArchitecturePatterns 


### Classification

#### Monolithic
##### [[Microkernel architecture]]
##### [[Layered architecture]]
##### [[Pipeline architecture]]
##### [[Modular monolith]]

#### Distributed
Contract (between remote components) creation, maintenance, versioning, coodination

##### Differences from monolithic
- *Availability* : remote service availability and responsiveness
- *Latency* : slower service invocations due to remote access protocols and distributed components
- *Security* : authenticating and authorizing remote connections and service invocations
- *Logging* : distributed logging facilities to provde a holistic view of a transaction
- *Transactions* : handling atomic transactions and transaction scope

##### [[Space-based architecture]]
##### [[Event-driven architecture]]
##### [[Microservices architecture]]
##### [[Service-based architecture]]
