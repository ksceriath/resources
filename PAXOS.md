... is a [[Consensus Algorithm]]

- This algorithm was given by Leslie Lamport.
- Paxos defines a protocol capable of reaching agreement on a single decision.
- This is referred to as Single Decree Paxos
- Multiple instances of this protocol are then combined to facilitate a series of decisions - i.e. a log
- This superset (of first problem) is called multi-Paxos.
- The details for multi-Paxos are not very well fleshed out in the Lamport's paper.
