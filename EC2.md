Elastic Compute Cloud

![[Excalidraw/EC2]]

Its a VM service provided by AWS.

EC2 has been used to host web servers, as well as databases. 

Compared to stateless web servers, databases require storage.

The storage was provided through an externally attached storage device.

-> Problem with this is that when the hardware the VM is provisioned fails, the data on the accompanying storage is also lost. [[EBS]] attempts to fix this.
