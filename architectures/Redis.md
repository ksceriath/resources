- An in-memory data store.
- deployment - *it is not uncommon to host the redis server on the same host as the application server, but general use-case seems to be hosted separately (mainly so that application servers can be scaled independently), at the cost of added network latency.*
- clustering - based on need, redis can be deployed as a cluster, with replication and sharding
