==> A **SINGLE** video file is streamed over the internet
==> The video automatically expands or contracts based on the screen size it is viewed on

--> Quality Issue : Video will be pixelated or stretched for different screen sizes
--> Buffering : Same file will be streamed to devices with poor internet connection. This can lead to unnecessary buffering.
