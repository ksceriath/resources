--> Compresses and Decompresses digital video files
--> Common codecs are H264 (AVC), MPEG-1, VP9
--> Different codecs have different trade-offs between *compression efficiency* and *visual quality*, and how much *computing power* is required
--> Advanced codecs like **VP9** provide better compression efficiency compared to older codecs like **H264**, at the cost of more computing power
